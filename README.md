# Dotfiles

I needed a publicly accessible source of truth for my dotfiles/utility scripts,
so here it is.

I added the unlicense because I don't like putting things out into the wild
without a license, but I really doubt anything here will be of interest to
anyone.

As such, feel free to fork if you like, but I'm not likely to accept PRs.
